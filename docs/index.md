###  Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository → **Settings**.  
2. Scroll to **Pages**.  
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.  
4. Choose the branch (usually `main`) and set the folder to `/docs`.  
5. Save — GitHub will publish your site at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

✅ This way, your documentation is live, versioned, and easy to share.  

Would you like me to also draft a **sidebar navigation structure** (like `docs/setup.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`) so your Pages site feels more like a full documentation portal?
